# JavaLesson
  Android Wrapper for java practice. Consists of branches for students to learn to code Java inside Android Studio. With this application, the sudents did not need to learn how to create buttons or work on the GUI environment. This code was handled for them. They simply had to write in Java. Since this was done in conjuction with having the students build an android application, it was important that they get used to working inside an Android IDE while also learning the tools and languages needed.

The following branches correspond to different environments for different java lessons.

- master: The application interface consists of a text field and an execute button. The students will write their code starting from a specific method, Start.main(). When the execute button is pressed, Start.main() is called. print methods were also created that add strings to the textfield on the android screen. A clear button has also been added to clear the screen of text.
- xuyingsort: Using the same interface as master, additional methods were added to allow students to practice implementing the sorting algorithms they had learned from one of the undergraduate students, Xuying Wang. 
- OOL_Lesson: This application consists of three buttons: Add Student, Delete Student, and Print Students. The object is to teach the students object oriented programming by creating and managing an array of objects of type Student. The object oriented lesson was taught by Ryan Darnell.

Solution branches were made for xuyingsort and OOL_Lesson for the students to reference later on.
